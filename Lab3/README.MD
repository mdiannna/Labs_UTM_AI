## Introduction
This is the solution for the Laboratory Nr 3 for the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals at the Technical University of Moldova. This project presents a linear regression model for predicting the price of an apartment given a set of characteristics of the apartment
complex it is part of.


## Technologies
-  Python
-  Colab Notebook - for running the code online
-  Scikit-learn library - for Linear Regression and data processing
-  Pandas library - for data manipulations and analysis
-  Numpy library - for working with numeric data
-  Seaborn library - for plots and visualisations
-  Matplotlib - for plots and visualisations


## How to run the program

For running the code, there are 2 options: 

1. Running on Google Colab 
2. Running with Jupyter notebook

### Running on Google Colab

To run on Google Colab, just upload this notebook to your Google Drive and open with Google Colab, then run all the cells.

### Running with Jupyter Notebook

To run with Jupyter, install first Python, then Jupyter Notebook:

``` $ pip install notebook```

For more details, see this link: [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install)

Then, install the required libraries:

- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- pandas

After that, launch the jupyter notebook with the command in terminal:

``` $ jupyter notebook```

(It is possible to install jupyter in a virtual environment)

Then, run all the cells from the notebook.
