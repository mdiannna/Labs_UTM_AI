        # Skin color? - daca detecteaza color from colors_list.txt
        # Provide suitable category for [color]
        # Or Yes/no
        # Or range questions (nr)

        #the rest that remain, ask :
        # The tourist wears a mask? [yes or no]   '(?x) wears a mask', - just replace (?x) with 'the tourist' and add question mark + [yes or no]
