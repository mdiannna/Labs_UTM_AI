# Code for Lab2 for the Fundamentals of AI Course at Technical University of Moldova, Flocking Behaviour

The task for this laboratory work consisted in implementing the flocking behaviour to the Solanum tuberosum rocks from the starship game. 

The simulation was based on a tool developed by Ijon, by using the code that was already provided in the Simulation.py file from the library. The code cruns on the Python3 version of codeskulptor: [https://py3.codeskulptor.org/](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/)

This implementation of the Flocking behaviour is based on the [Boids paper written by Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/), but also adds as other behaviours based on this model - the attacking and evading behaviours.
